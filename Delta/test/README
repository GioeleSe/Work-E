This directory is intended for PlatformIO Test Runner and project tests.

Unit Testing is a software testing method by which individual units of
source code, sets of one or more MCU program modules together with associated
control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to
determine whether they are fit for use. Unit testing finds problems early
in the development cycle.

Motor control JSON test (on device)
- Build `test/motor_control_test.cpp` with PlatformIO and upload to an ESP32 connected to motors.
- The test parses JSON samples from `test/jsons_data.h` (derived from `test/jsons.txt`) and
	calls `executeMotorControl()` for each `command == 2` payload.
- Open Serial at 115200 and visually confirm motor movement.
